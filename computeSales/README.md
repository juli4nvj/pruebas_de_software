## Programming Exercise:
	1. Compute sales
	
## Description
	Req 1. The program shall be invoked from a command line. The program shall receive two files as parameters. The first file will contain information in a JSON format about a catalogue of prices of products. The second file will contain a record for all sales in a company.
	
	Req 2. The program shall compute the total cost for all sales included in the second JSON archive. The results shall be print on a screen and on a file named SalesResults.txt. The total cost should include all items in the sale considering the cost for every item in the first file.
	
	The output must be human readable, so make it easy to read for the user.
	
	Req 3. The program shall include the mechanism to handle invalid data in the file. Errors should be displayed in the console and the execution must continue.
	
	Req 4. The name of the program shall be
		computeSales.py
	
	Req 5. The minimum format to invoke the program shall be as follows:
		python computeSales.py priceCatalogue.json salesRecord.json
	
	Req 6. The program shall manage files having from hundreds of items to thousands of items.
	
	Req 7. The program should include at the end of the execution the time elapsed for the execution and calculus of the data. This number shall be included in the results file and on the screen.
	
	Req 8. Be compliant with PEP8.
